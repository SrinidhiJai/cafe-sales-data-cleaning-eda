# ☕ Café Sales Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This is a full-cycle data cleaning and EDA project using a real-world messy dataset of café sales. The dataset includes customer transactions, payment methods, item details, and purchase amounts — sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/cafe-sales-dirty-data-for-cleaning-training).
